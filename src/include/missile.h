/**
**  @class MissileType missile.h
**
**  \#include "missile.h"
**
**  This structure defines the base type information of all missiles. It
**  contains all information that all missiles of the same type shares.
**  The fields are filled from the configuration files.
**
**
**  The missile-type structure members:
**
**  MissileType::Ident
**
**    Unique identifier of the missile-type, used to reference it in
**    config files and during startup.
**    @note Don't use this member in game, use instead the pointer
**    to this structure. See MissileTypeByIdent().
**
**  MissileType::DrawLevel
**
**    The Level/Order to draw the missile in, usually 0-255
**
**  MissileType::Width MissileType::Height
**
**    Size (width and height) of a frame in the image. All sprite
**    frames of the missile-type must have the same size.
**
**  MissileType::SpriteFrames
**
**    Total number of sprite frames in the graphic image.
**    @note If the image is smaller than the number of directions,
**    width/height and/or framecount suggest the engine crashes.
**    @note There is currently a limit of 127 sprite frames, which
**    can be lifted if needed.
**
**  MissileType::NumDirections
**
**    Number of directions missile can face.
**
**  MissileType::Transparency
**
**    Set a missile transparency.
**
**  MissileType::FiredSound
**
**    Sound of the missile, if fired. @note currently not used.
**
**  MissileType::ImpactSound
**
**    Impact sound for this missile.
**
**  MissileType::CanHitOwner
**
**    Can hit the unit that have fired the missile.
**    @note Currently no missile can hurt its owner.
**
**  MissileType::FriendlyFire
**
**    Can't hit the units of the same player, that has the
**    missile fired.
**
**  MissileType::Class
**
**    Class of the missile-type, defines the basic effects of the
**    missile. Look at the different class identifiers for more
**    information (::MissileClass::None, ...).
**
**  MissileType::NumBounces
**
**    This is the number of bounces, and it is only valid with
**    MissileClassBounce. The missile will hit this many times in
**    a row.
**
**  MissileType::StartDelay
**
**    Delay in game cycles after the missile generation, until the
**    missile animation and effects starts. Delay denotes the number
**    of display cycles to skip before drawing the first sprite frame
**    and only happens once at start.
**
**  MissileType::Sleep
**
**    This are the number of game cycles to wait for the next
**    animation or the sleeping between the animation steps.
**    All animations steps use the same delay.  0 is the
**    fastest and 255 the slowest animation.
**    @note Perhaps we should later allow animation scripts for
**    more complex animations.
**
**  MissileType::Speed
**
**    The speed how fast the missile moves. 0 the missile didn't
**    move, 1 is the slowest speed and 32 s the fastest supported
**    speed. This is how many pixels the missiles moves with each
**    animation step.  The real use of this member depends on the
**    MissileType::Class
**    @note This is currently only used by the point-to-point
**    missiles (::MissileClass::PointToPoint, ...).  Perhaps we should
**    later allow animation scripts for more complex animations.
**
**  MissileType::Range
**
**    Determines the range in which a projectile will deal its damage.
**    A range of 0 will mean that the damage will be limited to the
**    targeted unit only.  So if you shot a missile at a unit, it
**    would only damage that unit.  A value of 1 only affects the
**    field where the missile hits.  A value of 2  would mean that
**    the damage for that particular missile would be dealt for a range
**    of 1 around the impact spot. All fields that aren't the center
**    get only 1/SpashFactor of the damage. Fields 2 away get
**    1/(SplashFactor*2), and following...
**
**  MissileType::SplashFactor
**
**    Determines The Splash damage divisor, see Range
**
**  MissileType::Impact
**
**    The config of the next (other) missile to generate, when this
**    missile reached its end point or its life time is over.  So it
**    can be used to generate a chain of missiles.
**
**  MissileType::Smoke
**
**    The config of the next (other) missile to generate a trailing smoke.  So it
**    can be used to generate a chain of missiles.
**
**  MissileType::Sprite
**
**    Missile sprite image loaded from MissileType::File
**
**  MissileType::G
**
**    File containing the image (sprite) graphics of the missile.
**    The file can contain multiple sprite frames.  The sprite frames
**    for the different directions are placed in the row.
**    The different animations steps are placed in the column. But
**    the correct order depends on MissileType::Class. Missiles like fire
**    have no directions, missiles like arrows have a direction.
*/

/**
**  @class Missile missile.h
**
**  \#include "missile.h"
**
**  This structure contains all information about a missile in game.
**  A missile could have different effects, based on its missile-type.
**  Missiles could be saved and stored with CCL. See (missile).
**  Currently only a tile, a unit or a missile could be placed on the map.
**
**
**  The missile structure members:
**
**  Missile::position
**
**    Missile current map position in pixels.
**
**  Missile::source
**
**    Missile original map position in pixels.
**
**  Missile::destination
**
**    Missile destination on the map in pixels.  If
**    Missile::X==Missile::DX and Missile::Y==Missile::DY the missile
**    stays at its position.  But the movement also depends on
**    MissileType::Class.
**
**  Missile::Type
**
**    ::MissileType pointer of the missile, contains the shared
**    information of all missiles of the same type.
**
**  Missile::SpriteFrame
**
**    Current sprite frame of the missile.  The range is from 0
**    to MissileType::SpriteFrames-1.  The topmost bit (128) is
**    used as flag to mirror the sprites in X direction.
**    Animation scripts aren't currently supported for missiles,
**    everything is handled by MissileType::Class
**    @note If wanted, we can add animation scripts support to the
**    engine.
**
**  Missile::State
**
**    Current state of the missile.  Used for a simple state machine.
**
**  Missile::AnimWait
**
**    Animation wait. Used internally by missile actions, to run the
**    animation in parallel with the rest.
**
**  Missile::Wait
**
**    Wait this number of game cycles until the next state or
**    animation of this missile is handled. This counts down from
**    MissileType::Sleep to 0.
**
**  Missile::Delay
**
**    Number of game cycles the missile isn't shown on the map.
**    This counts down from MissileType::StartDelay to 0, before this
**    happens the missile isn't shown and has no effects.
**    @note This can also be used by MissileType::Class
**    for temporary removement of the missile.
**
**  Missile::SourceUnit
**
**    The owner of the missile. Normally the one who fired the
**    missile.  Used to check units, to prevent hitting the owner
**    when field MissileType::CanHitOwner==true. Also used for kill
**    and experience points.
**
**  Missile::TargetUnit
**
**    The target of the missile.  Normally the unit which should be
**    hit by the missile.
**
**  Missile::Damage
**
**    Damage done by missile. See also MissileType::Range, which
**    denoted the 100% damage in center.
**
**  Missile::TTL
**
**    Time to live in game cycles of the missile, if it reaches zero
**    the missile is automatic removed from the map. If -1 the
**    missile lives for ever and the lifetime is handled by
**    Missile::Type:MissileType::Class
**
**  Missile::Hidden
**
**    When you set this to 1 the unit becomes hidden for a while.
**
**  Missile::CurrentStep
**
**    Movement step. Used for the different trajectories.
**
**  Missile::TotalStep
**
**    Maximum number of step. When CurrentStep >= TotalStep, the movement is finished.
**
**  Missile::Local
**
**    This is a local missile, which can be different on all
**    computer in play. Used for the user interface (fe the green
**    cross).
**
**  Missile::MissileSlot
**
**    Pointer to the slot of this missile. Used for faster freeing.
