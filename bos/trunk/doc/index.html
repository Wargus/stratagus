<h1>Bos Wars</h1>
<hr>

    <h2>What is Bos Wars?</h2>
    Bos Wars is a futuristic real time strategy game (RTS). In a RTS game, 
    the player has to combat it's enemies while running his war economy. 
    Everything runs in so-called real-time, in opposition to turn-based games 
    where the player always has to wait for his turn. The trick is to balance 
    the effort put into building the economy and building an army to defend 
    and attack the enemies.
    </p><p>
    Bos Wars has a dynamic rate based economy. Energy is produced by power
    plants and magma gets pumped from hot spots. Buildings and mobile units 
    are also built at a continuous rate. Control of larger parts of the map 
    creates the potential to increase your economy throughput. Holding key 
    points like roads and passages allow for different strategies.
    </p><p>
    It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or
    against the computer. It successfully runs under Linux, MS Windows, BSD, 
    and Mac OS X.
    </p><p>
    Bos Wars aims to create a completely original and fun open source RTS game.
