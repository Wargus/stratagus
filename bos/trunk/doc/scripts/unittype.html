<a name="DefineBoolFlags"></a>
<h3>DefineBoolFlags( "flag-1", "flag-2", ...)</h3>

Define boolean unit flags. Examples are organic, mechanical, undead, etc.
Spells use these to determine who to hit, and units can be restricted too.
Try to avoid using names with other meanings (nothing from spell condition definition.)
Some Flags are already defined in the engine : the UnitType flags.
So following flags are the value of the unitType :
"Building", "BuilderOutSide", "BuilderLost", "ShoreBuilding",
"Coward", "Harvester", "Revealer",
"LandUnit", "AirUnit", "SeaUnit",
"ExplodeWhenKilled", "VisibleUnderFog", "PermanentCloack", "AttackFromTransporter",
"GroundAttack", "CanAttack", "CanHarvest",
"Vanishes", "Flip", "Decoration", "IsNotSelectable", "SelectableByRectangle",
"Indestructible".

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    DefineBoolFlags("organic", "hero", "mechanical", "undead", "demonic", "angelic")
</pre>

<a name="DefineVariables"></a>
<h3>DefineVariables( "varname-1", {tag = value}, "varname-2", {tag = value}, ...)</h3>

Define variable for unit. Spells could use these to determine who to hit, and units can be restricted too.
Try to avoid using names with other meanings (nothing from unit definitions
or spell condition definition).
tag = value represent default value for UnitType. These values can be overwritten in UnitType definition.

<dl>
  <dt>Value = number</dt>
  <dd>Initial value for the variable</dd>
  <dt>Max = number</dt>
  <dd>Max value for the number, assuming 0 is the min.</dd>
  <dt>Increase = number</dt>
  <dd>Number to add each second if possible, negative value are possible.</dd>
  <dt>Enable = boolean</dt>
  <dd>if the variable is active by default.
For example, Mana is active only for caster, but HP is available for every unit.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Note</h4>
Some variables are predefined and could be used with some restriction. You cannot modify their values,
there are readonly (but no errors are generated), So see DefineUnit() for initialise them
(some variables are computed in play and be initialised).
Also, the max value which is always greater than value, may have no sense or be equal at some player statistic.<br>
The predefined values are :
<dl>
  <dt>HitPoints</dt>
  <dd>Hp of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>Build</dt>
  <dd>State of the construction in building.</dd>
  <dt>Mana</dt>
  <dd>Mana point of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>Transport</dt>
  <dd>Number of unit inside (for transporter only, no build inside).</dd>
  <dt>Training</dt>
  <dd>Remaining cost to build the unit being training.</dd>
  <dt>UpgradeTo</dt>
  <dd>Time for the unit to upgrade to an other.</dd>
  <dt>GiveResource</dt>
  <dd>Resource that the unit gives ("resource-name" mine for exemple)</dd>
  <dt>Kill</dt>
  <dd>Number of unit killed by the unit.</dd>
  <dt>Armor</dt>
  <dd>Armor of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>SightRange</dt>
  <dd>Sight range of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>RadarRange</dt>
  <dd>Radar range of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>RadarJammerRange</dt>
  <dd>Radar Jamming range of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>AttackRange</dt>
  <dd>Attack range of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>PiercingDamage</dt>
  <dd>piercing damage of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>BasicDamage</dt>
  <dd>Basic damage of the unit.</dd>
  <dt>PosX</dt>
  <dd>X position of the unit. Max is the Map size.</dd>
  <dt>PosY</dt>
  <dd>Y position of the unit. Max is the Map size.</dd>
  <dt>AutoRepairRange</dt>
  <dd>Range to check for unit to repair. (for unit which can repair)<dd>
  <dt>Slot</dt>
  <dd>Unique number that identifies the unit (begin at 0). Max is the last valid slot number.</dd>

    DefineVariable("cooldown", {Value = 0, Increase = -1, Max = 50, Enable = false})
</pre>

<a name="DefineUnitType"></a>
<h3>DefineUnitType( "ident", { tag1 = value1, tag2  = value2, ...})</h3>

    Define the unit types in game. A lot of the data in this struct used to be
    based on the UDTA section of puds, with unit statistics, but it is now a lot
    bigger and more configurable.

<dl>
<dt>ident</dt>
<dd>The unit-type unique identifier.  It is used to reference unit-types in
game. F.E: "unit-knight", "unit-gold-mine". Please use all-lowercase names
prefixed with unit-, it is easier to read this way.
</dd>
</dl>
Possible tags:
<dl>
<dt>Name = "show-name"</dt>
<dd>The unit-type name shown in the game. F.E: "Knight", "Gold Mine".

the unit and most of the time it is equal to the tile size of the unit* the size
of a terrain tile, for an almost perfect fit.

</dd>
<dt>Sounds = {event, "sound-name", ...}</dt>
<dd>The following events are supported:
<dl><dd>
    <ul>
    <li>"selected": Happens when the unit is selected.
    <li>"acknowledge": Happens when the unit received an order.
    <li>"attack": Attack sound of the unit. Used when giving an attack order, it
    can override the acknowledge sound.

    <li>"repair": Happens when the unit is repairing.
    <li>"help": Happens when the unit is under attack.
    <li>"dead": Happens when the unit is killed.
    </ul></dd>
</dl></dd>
<dd>
You can use the same help or ready sound for all units if you want generic
"Your unit is under attack", "Some unit was trained" sounds. The actual sound
files are not declared here. Please see the documentation on <a href="sound.html#MakeSound">sounds</a>
</dd>
<!--

    <dd>Right clicking defaults to attack. This should be used for most combat units.
    </dd>

    </dd>
    <dt>"spell-cast"</dt>
    <dd>This is an ugly hack for demolishing units. The unit will cast it's first

    </dd>
</dl></dd>
<dt>GivesResource = resource-name</dt>
<dd>This will make the unit (normally a building) a resource (sugar mine, geyser, etc).

Use this for units that can't attack or are next to useless in combat (like
resource workers) Available as a spell target check.
</dd>
<dt>CanCastSpell = {spell-name, ...}</dt>
<dd>This is used to determine what spells can this unit cast. It is followed by a
list of spell names. Spells have to be declared already. Since some spells also
rely on units being defined this can lead to a chicken and egg problem. It's
better to declare an unit type in advance with just DefineUnitType( "unit-whatever", {}).
Please see the documentation on spells. F.E. CanCastSpell = {"spell-healing", "spell-exorcism"}
</dd>
<dt>RepairRange = number</dt>

</dd>
<dt>RandomMovementProbablitity = number</dt>
<dd>When the unit is idle this is the probability that it will take a
step in a random direction, in percents. Usefull for neutral animals.
</dd>
<dt>ClicksToExplode = number</dt>
<dd>If this is non-zero, then after that many clicks the unit will commit
suicide. Doesn't work with resource workers/resources.
</dd>
<dt>ComputerReactionRange = number</dt>
<dd>This is supossed to be the reaction range for AI units, but it is not used.
</dd>
<dt>PersonReactionRange = number</dt>
<dd>This is supossed to be the reaction range for human player units, but it is not used.
</dd>
<dt>Priority = number</dt>
<dd>This is the ai priority level. High damage low-hp units for instancce should have
higher priorities than say a peasant. It can be safely ignored.
</dd>
<dt>AnnoyComputerFactor = number</dt>
<dd>This is another ai priority level. This is not used, but included in wc2 data. Maybe
it should be used to attack resource buildings first? You can safely ignore it.
</dd>
<dt>Decay = number</dt>
<dd>This is the unit's decay rate, in 1/6 seconds. It should be really really really changed to
cycles. If you set this the unit will die by itself after a while. Don't use it for spells,
spells will override this with their own ttl setting.

<dd>The unit will start burning when it has less health than this, in percents.
</dd>
<dt>BurnDamageRate = number</dt>

</dd>
<dt>Points = number</dt>
<dd>This is the score value of an unit. Used for the final score.
</dd>
<dt>Missile = missile-name</dt>
<dd>Some units fire by throwing missiles, this is the missile thrown. You can use it for
close range units as well, but I can't really see the point.
</dd>
<dt>Corpse = {unittype-name, number}</dt>
<dd>This is the corpse of the unit. When the unit dies and passes through it's
death animation it turns into this. It's a list of an unit-name and a a corpse frame
number. As you can see in <a href="#DefineAnimations">DefineAnimations()</a>,
an animation is composed out of several script frames, this is the frame to
start the script from. FE: Corpse = {"unit-dead-body", 0}
</dd>
<dt>ExplodeWhenKilled = missile-name</dt>
<dd>Sets unit to explode when killed, syntax is followed by the missile to use.
eg. ExplodeWhenKilled "missile-explosion"
</dd>
<dt>DeathExplosion = explosion-function</dt>
<dd>Set the lua function that will create the particles of the explosion.
</dd>
<dt>AttackFromTransporter = boolean</dt>
<dd>Gives units with range the ability to attack from within a transporter such as a building.
These can act like amoured personnel carriers or bunkers
</dd>
<dt>CanTransport = {flag, "true" or "only" or "false", ...}</dt>
<dd>Unit is a transporter, you can place units with good flag inside.
<br>Note: If you want the unit to be able to transport all land unit, use CanTransport = {}.
<br>Note: you really should add an unload button for transporters.
<br>Note: flag must be defined before with <a href="#define-bool-flags">DefineBoolFlags()</a>
</dd>
<dt>MaxOnBoard = number</dt>
<dd>This is only used for transporters, It's the maximum allowed on board. Curently
you can't have more that 6, or you won't get any buttons for the rest.
</dd>
<dt>Revealer = boolean</dt>
<dd>This is a special flag to use for reveal map spells. A reveal map smell is
in fact a summon spell with an infinite range, that summons an unit with the
revealer flag. Revealer are summoned and marked removed, but they still keep
their sight. This way a revealer unit can't be attacked, won't show on the minimap
and can't be interacted with. Please see the documentation on spells.</dd>
<dt>SelectableByRectangle = boolean</dt>
<dd>Most units should have this flag. When false the unit will only get selected
alone, use this for buildings. Enemy units are never selectable by rectangle.
</dd>
<dt>flags = boolean</dt>
<dd>You can add a bunch of flags, defined with <a href="#DefineBoolFlags">DefineBoolFlags()</a>
You can add how many flags you would like, but keep in mind that you have to call
<a href="#DefineBoolFlags">DefineBoolFlags()</a> before.
</dd>
<dt>variable = {tag = value , ...} or number or boolean</dt>
<dd>You can add a bunch variable, defined with <a href="#DefineVariables">DefineVariables()</a>
You can add how many flags you would like, but keep in mind that you have to call
<a href="#DefineVariables">DefineVariables()</a> before.
You can overwrite each tag/value by the same method you use for <a href="#DefineVariables">DefineVariables()</a>
or simply Enable/disable it with a boolean, or set Max and value with a number
</dd>
<dt>CanTargetFlag = {flag, "true" or "only" or "false", ...}</dt>
<dd>This allows check for targetting similar to spell conditions.
By default everything is set to true, so you can target everything. Only means that
you can only fire units with that flag, and false only units without that flag.
</dd>
