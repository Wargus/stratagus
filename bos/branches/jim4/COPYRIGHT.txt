Bos Wars as a whole is distributed under the GNU general public

The license covers the whole game including all of the game scripts, graphics, 
and sounds. Note that if it did not, you would have no license and thus no 
right to use them. All the elements in Bos Wars, like for example 
the scripts or graphics, are all built (written, drawn, rendered,...) such 
that they link together.

Bos Wars as a whole forms a copyrighted work. Any project which 
uses *any* part of Bos Wars creates a derived work. As such the 
conditions of the GPL apply and for instance the resulting work (as a whole) 
must be licensed under the GPL too.

The GPL defines the source of a work to be the preferred form of the work 
for making modifications to it. This means for e.g. rendered images the 
complete 3d-model used to generate the image (e.g. including the raw images of 
the textures), or for music the midi files used to generate it (if done so) 
with the addditional patch sets.

The sources can be downloaded from the project website (http://bos.seul.org) or 
got upon request.
