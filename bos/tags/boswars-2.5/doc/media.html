<h1>Bos Wars Media Documentation</h1>

    <h2>Graphics</h2>
    Bos Wars graphics use a 256 color palette.<p>

    To see color indices in Gimp, open the 'Indexed Palette' dialog.<p>

    The color indexes 208 to 211 are reserved to display the player color.
    They go from lightest to darkest and will be replaced depending on the player color.
    The remaining colors may be used as regular colors.

    <h4>Buildings</h4>

    Buildings are simple to do. Each graphic consists of a .png file using 
    the palette format specified in the link above. The first frames in 
    the graphic form the animation of the building. The remaining frames
    form the animation of the construction of the building.
    Here is an example of 'camera.png'.<p>

    <img src="../units/camera/camera.png" alt="camera"><br>

    <h4>Units</h4>

    Units are a little more complex as there are more sections per graphic. 
    The 5 columns represent the directions. The rows are varied among 
    different type of graphics, see the script files for more info. Here is 
    an example of 'unit_engineer.png'. First 5 rows are used for movement, 
    next 5 for building, and the next 3 for dieing.<p>

    <img src="../units/engineer/unit_engineer.png" alt="engineer"><br>

    <h2>Sounds</h2>

    Any format of sound will work with Bos Wars, although to save space it is 
    recommended that you use 16 bit, 22050 kHz, mono format.<p>

    Look through the script files for existing media for more examples.<p>
