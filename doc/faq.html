<h1>FAQ for Stratagus Version 2.1</h1>
<hr>

For any questions not mentioned here, please visit
<a href="http://stratagus.org">http://stratagus.org</a>.<p>

    <b>Q: gzseek already defined or undefined.</b><br>
    A: You have an incompatible libpng version, install the latest version.<p>

    <b>Q: .depend:1: *** missing separator.  Stop.</b><br>
    A: The .depend file is broken, simply 'rm .depend' and 'make depend' 
    again. If the problem still occurs, you will need to 'make' without 
    making dependencies first.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Stratagus work with ALSA?</b><br>
    A: Yes, if you compiled SDL with alsa support and you compiled stratagus
    using SDL video mode.<p>

    <b>Q: Does Stratagus work with the W*rcr*ft 2 BNE version?</b><br>
    A: No. The file format of this version is currently not supported.<p>


    <b>Q: What W*rcr*ft 2 CD's do work with Stratagus?</b><br>
    A: If you have any trouble with extracting, please contact us.

	    <li>UK/Australian Expansion
	    <li>German Original
	    <li>German Expansion

	</ul><p>

    <b>Q: Can I use Stratagus to join in a W*rcr*ft 2 network game?</b><br>
    A: Sorry, Stratagus use its own network protocol. 
    The protocol needs the exact same code executed on all machines, 
    and it is not possible to have this with the original WC2, 
    therefore you can only connect to a Stratagus server.<p>

    <b>Q: What about other RTS games?</b><br>
    A: St*rcr*ft and W*rcr*ft 1 support is in development. T*ber*an Sun 
    may be added in the distant future. For the old C&amp;C games, you can 
    use freecnc.<p>

    <b>Q: What ports does the Stratagus network protocol use?</b><br>
    A: 6660 by default, you may start stratagus with '-Pxxxx' flag to 
    use port xxxx instead.<p>

    <b>Q: Does stratagus support internet/metaserver play?</b><br>
    A: Not yet, but this is a planned feature and may be added for 1.19<p>

    <b>Q: I get only a black window after I have installed it on windows.
    What have I done wrong?</b><br>
    A: Install Stratagus to the C: drive. This has solved the problem for
    everybody who has had this bug.<p>

    <b>Q: I have installed the windows version, when I start Stratagus I get
    only the splash screen and the game stops, but consumes 100% CPU. What
    have I done wrong?</b><br>
    A: Please wait for a couple of minutes for the game to start. There are
    some machines (Win98 and Win2000) that will still not start after some
    time.  On all machines I have tested it, it works.  I have no idea where
    the problem is, any help is welcome.<p>

    <b>Q: My question isn't answered here.</b><br>
    A: Submit a <a href="http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=84903&amp;atid=574266">support tracker item</a>.<p>
