<li>3.1.2 Released<p/></li>
  <ul>
     <li>Fixes for older Windows and Linux versions</li>
  </ul>
<li>3.1.1 Released<p/></li>
  <ul>
     <li>Allow forest generation to be slower (at minimum it can now be 2^40 seconds, before the minimum was 256 seconds)</li>
     <li>Allow regeneration rate to be slower (at minimum it can now be 1hp every 128 seconds, before 1hp every second)</li>
     <li>Allow all custom variable auto increases to be slower (at minimum it can now be +/-1 every 128 seconds, before it was +/-1 every second)</li>
  </ul>
<li>3.1.0 Released<p/></li>
  <ul>
    <li></li>
    <li>Optimized shared vison code.</li>
    <li>Now field of view parameters and auto targeting algorithm can be changed simultaneously for all computers of already started network game. It prevents desync causes. Mostly useful for debug.</li>
    <li>Map grid is optional now and can be disabled. Actual only for debug builds.</li>
    <li>Added enhanced type of fog of war, as long as original sprite-based fog can't be used when shadow caster is enabled. Also added few parameters to tune it (blur radius, number of blur iterations, number fog easing steps, bilinear interpolation).</li>
    <li>Added "elevated" flag for units/buildings which can look over opaque fields (f.eg. towers).</li>
    <li>Implemented shadow caster field of view type, which blocks vision through opaque obstacles (f.eg. cave walls in war1gus) or certain map tiles with enabled "opaque" flag. In additional there is a possibility to enable opacity for all rocks- OR forest- OR wall-tiles. This feature makes it possible to implement sight blocking for high/low ground .</li>
    <li>Extended editor abilities to support games adding dynamic unit lists</li>
    <li>Support innoextract single-file installers for game launchers, such as those used by GOG</li>
  </ul>
<li>3.0.0 Released<p/></li>
  <ul>
    <li>Migrate to SDL2, remove old direct OpenGL backend</li>
    <li>Migrate most custom code to handle image and audio formats, use SDL2_mixer and SDL2_image instead</li>
    <li>Force the AI to observe dependencies when upgrading in network games</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with units continuing to attack destroyed walls</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with units never finishing their move action if another unit appears at the goal position</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue when units would cease attacking non-threatening units of they came under attack, but their attacker is not reachable</li>
    <li>Fixed a potential segfault in the AI pathfinder</li>
    <li>Fixed a number of potential desyncs in network games, because the network random numbers where used for local sounds</li>
    <li>Fixed an issue with grayscale application for 4 bpp images</li>
    <li>Add an AlwaysThreat boolean flag for units that cannot attack but can cast spells and are thus still a danger for the AI</li>
    <li>Improve the displayed number of additional selected units</li>
    <li>Improve the pathfinding algorithm and related functions like retreating and roaming behavior</li>
    <li>Improve the target selection when attack ground is used</li>
    <li>Add support for online gaming via PVPGN</li>

    <li>Allow non-square pixel scaling to be set by games</li>
    <li>Fix flickering when rendering movies into widget surfaces</li>
  </ul>
<li>2.4.3 Released<p/></li>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Allow specifying colors, percentages, and border for the LifeBar.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Allow spaces in map names.
	  </li>
          <li>
            Fix spawning missile positions.
          </li>
          <li>
            Let AI players attack each other if the presets have been adjusted
            to move them to different teams.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix multiplayer desync, use local random function for building sound
            randomness.
          </li>
          <li>
            Use goal position of previous command as starting point for chained
            commands. This fixes sending a unit somewhere and then chaining the
            command to guard.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix an OpenGL crash on video playback.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow self-casting.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a flag for units that should snipe from a distance, so those
            units will try to stay out of range of others as much as
            possible. This fixes an issue whereby Alleria or a ballista would
            enter tower range needlessly.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a fix to make sure terrain resources are lost when harvesting
            actions are cancelled.
          </li>
          <li>
            Randomly play building sounds when constructing.
          </li>
          <li>
            Play shore sounds when units reach the shore.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add an action to let units auto-explore. This is also used so that
            AI players now send out exploration units across the map. (The
            latter is for effect.)
          </li>
          <li>
            Add a DemoMode to allow auto-playing AI demos from the main menu when idle.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix editor changing of surroundings to recurse until all transitions
            are done.
          </li>
          <li>
            Enable auto-cast during attack move.
          </li>
          <li>
            Allow casting on unit portraits.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fix an issue where the minimap was not updated after a building was destroyed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Add TTL percent calculation that can be used from Lua scripts to
            show the time to live for a summoned unit.
          </li>
          <li>
            Draw the click missile (the cross that is placed when ordering a
            unit) over the fog of war. It was invisible otherwise, and with
            order-lines disabled it was not clear if the order had been received.
          </li>
          <li>
            Improve the performance of the AI enemy finder. Ported from Wyrmgus.
          </li>
          <li>
            Print stack information on errors to get better bug reports.
          </li>
          <li>
            Support compilation on Haiku.
          </li>
          <li>
            Show panel index 2, even if only this unit has mana and not the
            entire unit type.
          </li>
          <li>
            Make code work with Lua 5.3. However, the build will still use 5.1
            because 5.2 and 5.3 are noticeably slower.
          </li>
	</ul>
</li><p/><li>2.4.2 Released<p/></li>
	<ul>
	  <li>
	    Force load progress to screen only every 500ms. On modern machines, loading
	    was so fast that almost all time was spent in screen redraw rather than loading.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Add support for game launchers to have optional contrib files that are just ignored if they are not present
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Add "make uninstall" target
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Reliability: Fall back to software and windowed rendering before
	    giving up on startup. This fixes the trouble some people have when
	    they enable OpenGL or an unsupported fullscreen resolution and now the
	    game won't start. Otherwise, they have to know where the
	    preferences.lua file is stored and either delete or edit it.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Commandline: -Z now takes a WIDTHxHEIGHT argument, too, to define the
	    base resolution to scale up from.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Bugfix: Warping mouse coordinates in zoomed mode was not scaled correctly.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Metaserver: Implement simple UDP hole punching to allow connections through some NATs
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Metaserver: Add CREATEGAME command
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Metaserver: Allow access for non-registered users
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Bugfix: Remove checksumming of lua files for now due to issues
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Installation: Include tinyfiledialogs and make extraction of game
	    data more consistent for games that want it by offering the
	    functionality on first launch based on header defines in the game
	    launchers.
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Bugfix: Regenerating forest tiles should no longer set the wrong tile index
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Graphics: Allow each game to ship its own shaders by searching in the game data path
	  </li>
	  <li>
	    Keybindings: Use Alt+/ and Alt+\ do change shaders globally
	  </li>
	</ul>

    <li>New tool written in C: wartool, includes all xxx2png in one file.</li>
    <ul>
    <li>Reworked the rectangle selection to match the one of w*rcr*ft 2: Select a group of player's "mobile" units. if none, select a construction from that player. if still none, select a (random) neutral unit (critter, mine...) if still none, select a (random) enemy unit.</li>
    <li>The dead body animation is now displayed.</li>
    <li>Fixed a bug in DestroyUnit(): Units in transporters weren't destroyed (although they were still "removed" from the map. There is still a problem though, as the dead bodies of the units in the transporters are displayed. Sorry I didn't look at this yet.</li>
    <li>Modified a couple of things in DestroyAllInside(), to speed up things in special cases (transporters, construction...)</li>
    <li>ChangeUnitOwner() is now recursive. This is not important for w*rcr*ft but it will be interesting for st*rcr*ft.</li>
    <li>Various code cleanups, code optimizations, minor changes, and things I forgot...</li>
    <li>AiFindFreeWorkers now finds free workers.</li>
    <li>In unit_find.c I added 2 functions FindUnitsByType() and FindPlayerUnitsByType(). These are general functions but used by the AI code and building construction/destruction (halls/lumber mill/...)</li>
    <li>I added ActionUnitConstructed test to UnitUnusable(): A building under construction can be considered unusable :). There is an exception though when you select a building under construction with the mouse. For example, the peons harvesting wood were bringing it back to the lumber mill under construction...</li>
    <li>When a keep/stronghold/castle/fortress is constructed, gold/wood/oil harvested is adjusted if necessary.</li>
    <li>Now when a castle/keep/stronghold/../lumber mill/refinery is destroyed, the gold/wood/oil harvested is correctly adjusted.</li>
    <li>It's now possible to cancel the construction of a building.</li>
    <li>New memory management. The main memory array isn't used directly anymore (except for debug message and network code), and the units are accessed by arrays of pointers (the solution isn't currently memory optimized, but this can be modified quite easily). There are currently 3 kind of "lists": Used unit slots, free unit slots, and a list of units used by each player. This implies a bunch of (more or less) small changes through the code...</li>
    <li>Gold mined, wood harvested and oil hauled is added to the player's resources as soon as the peon/peasant reach the hall/mill/... Note that this is the standard behaviour of w*rcr*ft 2. This part generates a bunch of warnings from the AI saying that it can't build a farm. This is just this: a warning. As soon as it is possible (the peon gets out of the hall), the farm is builded.</li>
