    <H2>What is FreeCraft?</H2>

    FreeCraft was formerly known as ALE Clone.<BR>
    It is a clone of the real-time fantasy strategy game W*rCr*ft II.<P>
    FreeCraft is a free cross-platform real-time strategy gaming engine.
    It is possible to play against human opponents over LAN, internet, or
    against the computer. The engine can be used to build C&C, WC2, SC and
    AOE-like real-time strategy (RTS) games. It successfully runs under Linux,
    BSD, BeOS, MacOS/X, MacOS/Darwin and MS Windows (Windows XP is not
    supported).
    <P>
    Since the FreeCraft engine doesn't provide graphics, sounds and
    documentation,<BR>
    you'd need the <B>original game</B> so FreeCraft can extract the necessary
    files.<BR>
    The BNE version is currently not supported, you must own the old DOS
    version.<BR>
    (With over 1 million sold copies this shouldn't be a big problem)<P>
    Alternative you could download the free media (sounds and graphics) from
    the:<BR>
