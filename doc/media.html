<h1>Stratagus 2.1 Media Documentation</h1>
<hr>

    <h2>Graphics</h2>

    Please take a look at <a href="graphics/palette.html">graphics/palette.html</a> 
    before working on graphics to get an idea of the palette.

    <h4>Buildings</h4>

    Buildings are simple to do. Each graphic consists of a .png file using 
    the palette format specified in the link above. The top half of the graphic 
    is used for the main image, and the bottom half is for the construction. 
    Here is an example of 'farm.png'. Please also see the ccl files.<p>

    <img src="graphics/farm.png" alt=farm><br>

    <h4>Units</h4>

    Units are a little more complex as there are more sections per graphic. 
    The 5 columns represent the directions. The rows are varied among 
    different type of graphics, see the ccl files for more info. Here is 
    an example of 'peasant.png'. First 5 rows are used for movement, 
    next 5 for chopping, and the next 3 for dieing. Note that the peasant 
    has 2 other graphics, one for carrying gold, another for carrying wood.<p>

    <img src="graphics/peasant.png" alt=peasant><br>

    <h2>Sounds</h2>

    Any format of sound will work with Stratagus, although to save space it is 
    recommended that you use 16 bit, 22050 kHz, mono format. To save more 
    space, it is recommended that you gzip the file too.<p>

    All the sound entry data is in data/ccl/sound.ccl, 
    Here is an example ccl entry for: data/sounds/human/buildings/farm.wav.gz<p>

    <pre>(make-sound "farm-selected" "human/buildings/farm.wav")</pre><p>

    Note how the '.gz' suffix isn't needed in the ccl entry, 
    the Stratagus engine detects this automatically.<p>

    You may look through the ccl file for more examples.<p>
