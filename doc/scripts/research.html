<h2>Intro - Introduction to research functions and variables</h2>

Everything around researching and upgrades.
<h2>Functions</h2>

<a name="CheckDependency"></a>
<h3>CheckDependency()</h3>

NOT WRITTEN YET.


<dl>
<dt>.</dt>
<dd>.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    CheckDependency()
</pre>

<a name="DefineUnitAllow"></a>
<h3>DefineUnitAllow(name, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N, N)</h3>

Define how many units of a given type each player can have.

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Name of an unit-type to be defined.
</dd>
<dt>N</dt>
<dd>
  The initial quantity of units per type at level start.
  Each player has his quatinty, the first is for player 0 and the last
  is for player 15.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Allow 1 catapult for the 2nd player.
    DefineUnitAllow("unit-catapult", 0, 1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
</pre>


<a name="DefineAllow"></a>
<h3>DefineAllow(name, str16)</h3>

Define what upgrades are enabled for each player during
a level.

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Name of an upgrade to be defined.
</dd>
<dt>str16</dt>
<dd>
  The initial allow state for the upgrade at level start:
  <ul>
  <li>A - Allowed
  <li>E - Enabled, allowed by level but currently forbidden
  <li>F - Forbidden
  <li>R - Researched or acquired
  <li>Q - Acquired but currently forbidden (does it make sense?:)
  </ul>
  Each player has his own character, the first is for player 0 and the last
  is for player 15.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Allow the metal upgrade for all 16 players.
    DefineAllow("upgrade-metal", "AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA")
    --                            ^- player 0    ^- player 15
</pre>



<a name="DefineDependency"></a>
<h3>DefineDependency( unit-type/upgrade ...)</h3>

Define the dependencies for an unit-type or an upgrade. The dependency
must be full filled before an unit or research can be used.
<p>
<code>DefineDependency unit-type/upgrade '( required-part )
     ['or '( optional-or-part ) ...] )
</code>

<dl>
<dt>required-part</dt>
<dd><code>unit/upgrade [count]</code><p>
   A list of unit-types or upgrades required.
   <dl>
   <dt>unit/upgrade</dt>
   <dd>Unit-type name or upgrade name required.
   </dd>
   <dt>count</dt>
   <dd>Optional count, how many units of the unit-type are required.
   </dl>
</dd>
<dt>'or optional-or-part</dt>
<dd><code>unit/upgrade [count]</code><p>
    Optional list of or parts. One or list must be complete full filled.<p>

   <dt>unit/upgrade</dt>
   <dd>Unit-type name or upgrade name required.
   </dd>
   <dt>count</dt>
   <dd>Optional count, how many units of the unit-type are required.
   </dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- The second sword upgrade is only possible, if the first sword upgrade is
    -- researched.
    (define-dependency "upgrade-sword2" '(upgrade-sword1))
    -- The ranger upgrade is only available if a keep or castle is available.
    (define-dependency 'upgrade-ranger '(unit-keep) 'or '(unit-castle))
</pre>

<a name="DefineModifier"></a>
<h3>DefineModifier("upgrade-name", {effect1, effect1-arg}, {effect2, effect2-arg}, ... )</h3>

  <dd>The modifiers are applied to this unit-type or upgrade.</dd>
  <dt>{"convert-to", "unit-type"}</dt>
  <dd>All units of the unit-types given with '(apply-to ...) are converted

  </dd>
  </dl>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<dt>"costs", {time, resource1, resource2, resource3, resource4, resource5, resource6}</dt>
