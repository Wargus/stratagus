<h2>Intro - Introduction to AI functions and variables</h2>

Everything around the control of the Stratagus AI.

<p>
Warning: The AI documentation is slightly outdated. This documentation hasn't 
been fully converted to the lua API yet.
<p>

<h2>How does it work</h2>

AI in Stratagus is script based. Each AI player keeps executing scripts.
There are two kinds of scripts : 
<ul>
  <li>The main script. It starts buildings, upgrades, ...</li>
  <li>The action/reaction scripts. They are started by the AI engine, under certain condition.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
Scripts can arrange and control units using forces : <br>
A script can ask for some type of unit in a force (using <a href="#AiForce">AiForce</a>), 
and then wait for them to be ready (using <a href="#AiWaitForce">AiWaitForce</a>).<br>
<br>
<br>
The force 0 is a special case : it holds all the unassigned units, and is used to fill other forces. 
( when needed, units are transfered from force 0 to others ). Attacker units in force 0 won't be used for attacks<br>
Forces from 1 to 3 are also special : They are used as the attack reserve. 
Attack forces will only be created using units available in those forces.<br>
<br>
The main script is responsible for setting minimums for the forces 0 and 1. This will influence the balance
between defend and attack for an AI player.<br>
<br>

<h2>Functions</h2>
<a name="DefineAi"></a>
<h3>DefineAi(name, race, class, script)</h3>

This defines how a special AI works. Each level can use his own AI definition.

<dl>
<dt>name</dt>
<dd>Unique name of this AI definitions.
</dd>
<dt>race</dt>
<dd>Name of the race for what this definition can be used, if the definition
    can be used for any race use "*".
</dd>
<dt>class</dt>
<dd>Class name of this definition. Used to choose the AI for computer players.
The puds contains numbers which are mapped by the C table AiTypeWcNames into
internal names. Some common used names are "passive", "land-attack",
"sea-attack", "air-attack".
</dd>
<dt>script</dt>
<dd>A lua function.<p>
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Defines the passive computer AI, which does nothing.
DefineAi("passive-ai", "*", "passive", function() AiSleep(10000) end)
</pre>

<a name="DefineAiHelper"></a>
<h3>DefineAiHelper(list)</h3>

The AI is complete configurable, nothing is hardcoded. The AI knows nothing
about any units without this table. This table defines F.E. what unit can build
and what they can build and many other things that the AI must know.

<h4>Example</h4>

A minimal AI helper definition:

<pre>
DefineAiHelper(
  {"build", "unit-peasant", "unit-farm"},
  {"train", "unit-town-hall", "unit-peasant"},
  {"upgrade", "unit-town-hall", "unit-keep"},
  {"research", "unit-human-blacksmith", "upgrade-sword1"},
  {"repair", "unit-peasant", "unit-town-hall"},
  {"unit-limit", "unit-farm", "food"},
  {"unit-equiv", "unit-town-hall", "unit-keep"})
</pre>

<p>A peasant can build a farm.
<p>The town hall can train a peasant.
<p>A town hall can be upgraded to a keep.
<p>The blacksmith can reasearch the upgrade sword1.
<p>A peasant can repair the town hall.
<p>To fix the food shortage the AI must build farms.
<p>For the AI is a keep equivalent to a town hall.

</dl>
 
<i>The force isn't moved as a single unit: faster units attacks first, than later the
slower units will attack.</i>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
   -- Force 0 is built with one assault unit. The script continues processing, when
   -- the assault unit is ready. When ready, the script attacks the opponent

<h3>AiForce(force, unit-type-1, count-1, ... ,unit-type-N, count-N)</h3>

Define a force, what and how many units should belong to a force. Up to 10
forces are currently supported.
<br>
Force 0 is currently fixed to be the defence force. Send to a building or
unit under attack.
<br>

</dd>
</dl>

<i>The unit-types should be build in a fixed order. From left to right? or from
each unit-type one after the other?</i>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- First the force 0 is filled up with 4 footmans and 5 bowmans, after this
    -- force 1 is filled with 3 footmans and 2 bowmans.
    AiForce(0, "unit-footman", 4, "unit-bowman", 5)

</pre>

<a name="AiGetSleepCycles"></a>
<h3>AiGetSleepCycles()</h3>

Get the number of cycles to sleep.


<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Returns the number of cycles to sleep.
    AiGetSleepCycles()
</pre>

<h3>AiNeed(unit-type)</h3>

Tells the AI that it should have a unit of this unit-type. The AI builds or
trains units in this order of the AiSet/AiNeed commands. If the unit or an
equivalent unit already exists, the AI does nothing. If the unit is lost, it is
automatically rebuilt. If the units are requested in wrong order, the AI could 
hang up. Resources are collected automatic and farms are automatic build, but
additional could be requested.


<dl>
<dt>unit-type</dt>
<dd>Name of the unit-type required.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- The great hall must be build before a barrack.
  AiNeed("unit-great-hall")
  AiNeed("unit-barrack")
</pre>

<a name="AiPlayer"></a>
<h3>AiPlayer()</h3>

Return the player of the running AI.


<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Returns the player of the running AI.
    player = AiPlayer()
</pre>

<a name="AiResearch"></a>
<h3>AiResearch(upgrade)</h3>

Let the AI research an upgrade, upgrades are reseached in command order.
And automatic researched if lost. Building orders have a higher priority.
The script writer is responsible for the correct order. If wrong the
AI could hang up.


<dl>
<dt>upgrade</dt>
<dd>Upgrade name to be researched.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Research a better armor for land units.
    AiResearch("upgrade-shield1")
</pre>

<a name="AiSet"></a>
<h3>AiSet(unit-type, count)</h3>

This AiNeed with a number. Tells the AI that it should have a specified number
of a unit of this unit-type. The AI builds or trains units in this order of
the AiSet/AiNeed commands. If the unit or an equivalent unit already exists,
the AI does nothing. If the units are lost, they are automatic rebuild. If the
units are requested in wrong order, the AI could hang up. Resources are
collected automatic and farms are automatic build, but additional could be
requested. In the opposite to AiNeed, which always inserts a request, AiSet
modifies the last request to the new number.


<dl>
<dt>unit-type</dt>
<dd>Name of the unit-type(s) required.
</dd>
<dt>count</dt>
<dd>Number of unit-types(s) required.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    --  Request two assault units.
    AiSet("unit-assault", 2)
</pre>

<a name="AiSetCollect"></a>
<h3>AiSetCollect(time, resource1, resource2, ...)</h3>

<dd>Time in game cycles.
</dd>
<dt>resource1</dt>
<dd>Percentage needed for the first resource.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Set the collect percent to 50% gold and 50% wood.
    AiSetCollect(0, 50, 50, 0, 0, 0, 0)
</pre>

<a name="AiSetReserve"></a>
<h3>AiSetReserve(time, resource1, ...)</h3>

Set AI player resource reserve.


<dl>
<dt>time</dt>
<dd>Time in game cycles.
</dd>
<dt>reource1</dt>
<dd>first resource.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Set all of the reserves to 0.
    AiSetReserve(0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0)
</pre>

<a name="AiSleep"></a>
<h3>AiSleep(frames)</h3>

Wait some frames, to let the opponent (you) recover.


<dl>
<dt>frames</dt>
<dd>How many frames (~1/30s) the AI shouldn't proceed with the script.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    {
      -- Wait 500 frames ~16s.
      function() return AiSleep(500) end,
    }
</pre>

<a name="AiUpgradeTo"></a>
<h3>AiUpgradeTo(unit-type)</h3>

Upgrade units to an improved type. You must give for each unit you want to
upgrade an upgrade command. The computer automatic searches which unit it
upgrades.


<dl>
<dt>unit-type</dt>
<dd>Unit type to that a unit should be upgraded.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Upgrade a town-hall to keep.
    AiUpgradeTo("unit-keep")
</pre>

<a name="AiWait"></a>
<h3>AiWait(type)</h3>

Waits until the *first* request of this unit-type is completed.
Don't forget to request a unit-type, before you wait on it.

<dl>
<dt>type</dt>
<dd>Wait for this unit type.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Proceed only if a peasant is ready.
    AiNeed("unit-peasant")
    AiWait("unit-peasant")
</pre>

<a name="AiWaitForce"></a>
<h3>AiWaitForce(force)</h3>

Wait until a force is complete, the forces are build in force number order.
First 0, than 1, last 9.


<dl>
<dt>force</dt>
<dd>Number of the force to which the units should belong. 0 - 9 is currently
supported.
</dd>
</dl>

<h4>Example</h4>

<pre>
    -- Force 0 is build with one footman. The script continues processing, if the
    -- footman is ready trained.
    AiForce(0, "unit-footman", 1)
    AiWaitForce(0)
</pre>

<h2>Notes</h2>

The current AI script support is very limited, many new functions are needed.
If you want to write this you know who to contact.

<h2>Examples</h2>

<pre>
DefineAi("wc2-example", "orc", "land-attack",
 function()
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
This is the AI "wc2-example" usable for orc race and land-attack.
</p><pre>
     AiNeed("unit-great-hall")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
The first need unit is the great-hall.
</p><pre>
     AiNeed("unit-peon")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
The next unit should be the peon.
</p><pre>
     AiWait("unit-great-hall")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
Now wait until the great hall is available. Could hang if no great hall can be
build.
</p><pre>
     AiWait("unit-peon")
</pre><p style="margin-left:1cm;">
Now wait unit we have a worker to build the next things.
</p>

FIXME: need some complex examples.
