    <H2>Software Requirements</H2>

You need:
<UL>
	<LI>Operating system:
	<UL>
	<LI>Linux System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>Linux System with console (graphic card) supported by svgalib.
	<LI>Any BSD System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>Maybe any other Unix/POSIX OS with X Windows System installed.
	    You may have to create the configuration by hand and install
	    additional non-common libraries (see below) and gcc (untested).
	<LI>BeOS System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>MacOS System with an installed X Windows System.
	<LI>X Windows System with 8/15/16/24/32bit X Server.
	    Remote displays aren't supported!
	<LI>On Unix/BSD-like systems, you'll need bash for the setup script.
	<LI>Win32 system:
	    <UL>
	    <LI>For network play, Win95 OSR2 (aka Win95b) or higher is required,
		since some features of Winsock2 (WS2_32.DLL) are used. We will try
		to emulate this using WSOCK32.DLL features in future versions, but
		that code is not in yet.<BR>
		For now this MS <A HREF="http://www.microsoft.com/windows95/downloads/contents/WUAdminTools/S_WUNetworkingTools/W95Sockets2/Default.asp">download</A> link might help. You must
		install WS2_32.DLL even if you don't intend to play over a network,
		otherwise FreeCraft won't start.
	    <LI>WinNT needs to be WinNT4.0 + Service Pack 3 or higher, for the same
		reasons.
	    </UL>
	</UL>
	<LI>libpng.
	<LI>zlib.
	<LI>SIOD. (Included in the distribution)
	<LI>The original game CD or expansion CD for manuals and maindat.war
	    for graphics and sfxdat.sud for sounds.
	    <BR>Or use the free replacements of graphics and sounds from the
		FreeCraft Media Project.
</UL>
These are optional:
<UL>
	<LI>libpthread	(For threaded sound support)
	<LI>SVGALib	(for console support)
	<LI>SDL		(Additional SDK support)
	<LI>Bzip2	(Freely available, high-quality data compressor) 
	<LI>ZZIPlib	(Read access on ZIP-archives)
</UL>

    <H2>Hardware Requirements</H2>

To use this program you need the following hardware:

<UL>
	<LI>At least an i586 133 MHz (faster recommended) and 16 MB of RAM
	    (32 MB for mp3/ogg support).
	<LI>Any graphic card running with X11 or SVGALib or Win32 in 640x480.
	<LI>with 8/16/24/32 bpp video modes working.
	<LI>Freecraft is believed to be endian and word size safe, so other
	    architectures like (big endian) PPC or (64bit) Alpha should also
	    work at least with Linux.
</UL>

    <H2>Installation</H2>

    <H3>Unix or BSD</H3>
<A NAME="unix-src"></A>

    <H4>Unix or BSD source</H4>

	<LI><B>With the media from the FreeCraft Media Project:</B>
	<UL>
	<LI>FcGP (graphic) and FcSP (sound) are now combined in the FcMP

  	<LI>Type "make". (Should compile without errors :-)
	<LI>Optional:
	    <UL>
	    <LI>Edit "data/ccl/freecraft.ccl" to configure FreeCraft
		for your own needs.
