<P><LI>Version 1.15
    <UL>

    <LI>Applied patches: new sound configuration and api. (Fabrice Rossi)
    <LI>Changed &lt;strings.h&gt; to &lt;string.h&gt; for glibc-2.1.
    <LI>Applied patches from lokh:
    <UL>
<LI>Gold mined, wood harvested and oil hauled is added to the player's
    resources as soon as the peon/peasant reach the hall/mill/...
    Note that this is the standard behaviour of w*rcr*ft 2.
    This part generates a bunch of warnings from the AI saying that it
    can't build a farm. This is just this: a warning. As soon as it is
    possible (the peon gets out of the hall), the farm is builded.
<LI>New memory management. The main memory array isn't used directly
    anymore (except for debug message and network code), and the units
    are accessed by arrays of pointers (the solution isn't currently
    memory optimized, but this can be modified quite easily).
    There are currently 3 kind of "lists": Used unit slots, free unit
    slots, and a list of units used by each player.
    This implies a bunch of (more or less) small changes through the
    code...
<LI>It's now possible to cancel the construction of a building.
<LI>Now when a castle/keep/stronghold/../lumber mill/refinery is 
    destroyed, the gold/wood/oil harvested is correctly adjusted.
<LI>When a keep/stronghold/castle/fortress is constructed, gold/wood/oil
    harvested is adjusted if necessary.
<LI>I added ActionUnitConstructed test to UnitUnusable(): A building 
    under construction can be considered unusable :). There is an
    exception though when you select a building under construction with
    the mouse.
    For example, the peons harvesting wood were bringing it back to the
    lumber mill under construction...
<LI>In unit_find.c I added 2 functions FindUnitsByType() and 
    FindPlayerUnitsByType(). These are general functions but used by the
    AI code and building construction/destruction (halls/lumber mill/...)
<LI>AiFindFreeWorkers now finds free workers.
<LI>Various code cleanups, code optimizations, minor changes, and things
    I forgot...
<LI>ChangeUnitOwner() is now recursive. This is not important for w*rcr*ft but
    it will be interesting for st*rcr*ft.
<LI>Modified a couple of things in DestroyAllInside(), to speed up things in
    special cases (transporters, construction...)
<LI>Fixed a bug in DestroyUnit(): Units in transporters weren't destroyed
    (although they were still "removed" from the map. There is still a problem
    though, as the dead bodies of the units in the transporters are displayed.
    Sorry I didn't look at this yet.
<LI>The dead body animation is now displayed.
<LI>Reworked the rectangle selection to match the one of w*rcr*ft 2:
    Select a group of player's "mobile" units.
    if none, select a construction from that player.
    if still none, select a (random) neutral unit (critter, mine...)
    if still none, select a (random) enemy unit.
    </UL>
    <LI>New tool written in C: wartool, includes all xxx2png in one file.
    <LI>Fixed bug: Files from tool directory are not included in the
	distribution.
    <LI>Applied patches from Vladi.
    <UL>
<LI>MapField.SeenTile -- used for the wood/rocks last seen fog bug :)
<LI>Macros MAPEXPLORED, MAPVISIBLE... added
<LI>Fixed bug: Wood removing should be ok.
<LI>Fixed bug: Fog of war should be ok.
<LI>Fixed bug: Fixes seen wood bug.
<LI>Added cheats -- for debug really :)
<LI>Added TileTypeTables -- used to lookup what tile is what? i.e. which tiles
    are woods, water,... required for the fog
<LI>Rewritten DrawUnits
<LI>Added Unit.rs which is filled by MakeUnit() with random number between 1
    and 100, used for fancy buildings. `fancy buildings'! every building is
    drawn randomly normal or flipped horizontally, so the your city will have
    some buildings pointed to right and some to left! i.e. will not look
    uniform.
<LI>Fixed bug: in UnitVisible() for fog of war
<LI>Added Now enemy buildings will look under the fog with the last 
    seen frame (or will not show if you haven't seen them yet)
    FIXME: if seen building under fog is ruined it will disappear
<LI>Added DrawResources() shows food usage now.
<LI>Added Unit.PendCommand, now TownHall and Barracks have `move', `stop',
    `attack' and `harvest' commands ( and RightClick will do it ), which will
    be applied auto to all new units.
<LI>Fixed: `case 1...100' thing --&gt; with default:if(...&lt;100)                    
    </UL>
    <LI>Rewritten DrawUnits, combined work.
    <LI>Moved map.c minimap.c and tileset.c into own directory map.

    <LI>Fixed bug: Area too big for CursorOnMap.
    <LI>Add smart cache for map background drawing.
    <LI>All the background drawing stuff could be compile time configured.
